The Navbar component is a responsive navigation bar that contains a mobile menu and desktop menu. It has a toggle button for the mobile menu, which is hidden on desktop devices, and a logo.

### State

The component uses the useState hook to keep track of the state of the mobile menu. When the mobile menu is open, the state is set to true, and when it is closed, the state is set to false. The initial state is set to false using the useState hook.

### Navbar Container

The navbar container is a nav element with a class of bg-gray-800 for the background color. The md:w-64 class sets the width of the navbar to 64 pixels on medium-sized screens and above. The md:flex-shrink-0 class prevents the navbar from shrinking on medium-sized screens and above.

### Mobile Menu Button

The mobile menu button is a button element with a class of inline-flex items-center justify-center p-2 rounded-md text-gray-400 hover:text-white hover:bg-gray-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-offset-gray-800 focus:ring-white.

When the button is clicked, the onClick event sets the state of isMobileMenuOpen to the opposite of its current value using the setIsMobileMenuOpen function.

The button contains two svg elements for the hamburger and close icons. The hidden and block classes are used to show and hide the icons depending on the state of the mobile menu.

### Desktop Menu and Logo

The desktop menu and logo are contained within a div element. The hidden and block classes are used to show and hide the desktop menu depending on the state of the mobile menu.

The md:flex-grow class allows the menu to expand to fill the remaining space on medium-sized screens and above. The md:flex, md:flex-col, and md:justify-start classes set the direction and alignment of the menu items. The md:items-stretch class stretches the menu items to fill the available space.

The logo is contained within a div element with a class of flex-shrink-0 px-4 py-2 bg-gray-900. The text-lg, font-medium, and text-white classes set the size, weight, and color of the text. You can replace the text "Logo" with your own logo.

The menu links are contained within a div element with a class of flex-grow md:flex md:flex-col md:overflow-y-auto. The overflow-y-auto class allows the menu to scroll if there are too many items to fit on the screen. The menu links are contained within a elements with a class of text-gray-300 hover:text-white block px-3 py-2 rounded-md text-base font-medium. You can replace the text "Link 1", "Link 2", and "Link 3" with your own links.
