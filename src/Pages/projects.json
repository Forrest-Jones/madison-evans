		"title": "Palette Pal",
		"description": "Palette Pal is a React-based web app that enables users to upload images and create color palettes by breaking down the image into its constituent pixels and projecting them into RGB color space. The app employs a K-means clustering algorithm to cluster similar pixels and generate a specified number of colors to represent the image. Users can select the number of colors they want in their palette and copy the corresponding hex codes for use in their design projects. The app runs entirely client-side, including the clustering algorithm, to ensure maximum performance. Palette Pal is an excellent tool for developers and designers who want to create color themes quickly based on images.",

		"title": "Drop the Ball",
		"description": "Drop The Ball is an interactive game developed using Vanilla Javascript and HTML Canvas, featuring animation and physics simulation. The game involves dropping a ball into a virtual peg board where the ball adheres to gravity and bounces off the pegs. The physics simulation is implemented using mathematical equations to accurately simulate the ball's movement and collision with the pegs. The HTML canvas is used to render the game graphics and create the user interface. Overall, 'Drop The Ball' is a fun and engaging project that showcases the power of Vanilla Javascript and HTML Canvas for game development.",
